General Process
  - We used the planning poker technique to estimate user stories as a team. These estimates will help prioritize our development timeline.
Background Data
  - The team initially struggled with defining the scope of certain user stories. For instance, "Create Grocery List" was too broad, so we decided to break it down into smaller tasks such as "Add item to list" and "Set a reminder."
